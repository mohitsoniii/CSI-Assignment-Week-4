# CSI-Assignment-Week-4
In this assignment we learnt the creation of a basic web server using Express.js. It includes middleware for logging request details with timestamps, handles routing for two endpoints (/ and /about), and implements a 404 handler for undefined routes. The project provides a simple introduction to Express server setup, middleware, and routing.
